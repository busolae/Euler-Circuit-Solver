# Euler Circuit Solver 🔄⚡  
### Java | Graph Theory | Backtracking Algorithm  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **brute-force backtracking algorithm** to find **Eulerian circuits** in **undirected graphs**.  
It was developed as part of **CPS420 (Algorithm Design) at Toronto Metropolitan University**.  

## 🖥️ Features  
- ✅ Uses **DFS traversal** and **graph connectivity checks** to determine Eulerian properties.  
- ✅ Implements **backtracking** to construct a valid Eulerian circuit if possible.  
- ✅ Works with adjacency matrices and Java collections for efficient graph processing.  
- ✅ Includes a **test suite** and `makefile` for automated compilation and grading.  

## 🛠️ Technologies  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Algorithms:** Graph Traversal (DFS), Backtracking  
- **Development Environment:** Linux (TMU CS moons), Makefile
